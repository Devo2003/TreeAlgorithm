# TreeAlgorithm
NOTE: Ignore the createTree cs class file that isnt needed for this assignment.

In this assignment I create a tree that reads a text file that is converted into an array and then is 
fitted in a tree structure to be ordered from least to createst. I go into more detail in my comments on what 
method does what in the project.
